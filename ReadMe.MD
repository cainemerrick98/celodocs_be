# CeloDocs API

A personal project for my team at work. 

An API that can receive queries about the celonis platform, find the relevant information in the product documentation and pass this information through an LLM to give the user an answer to the query. 

Essentially its a RAG pipeline for my teams technical product documentation

I plan to deploy the API and provide a borwser extension interface to interact with the product
